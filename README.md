## Features

### Existing Features

#### Features used across all pages
* **Header**
    * Header - navigation bar has been built using Bootstrap "fixed-top" class to allow easy navigation for users throughout the website. 
    It is positioned on top of the page and remains visible on all screen size devices.
    * Navigation bar includes a brand logo and links to the four pages of the website: Home, Plan and Store, Love your Leftovers and Contact Us.
    * Navigation links are collapsed in small screen sizes into a hamburger menu. 
    * Brand logo serves as a Home page link, in addition to the Home link in the navbar. It is particularly convinient for users accessing the website on 
    smaller screen devices to get back to the Home page without having to use the hamburger menu.
    * All navigation links change color to green on hover and the current page's link stays "active", so the users can easily identify the page they are on.

* **Footer**
    * Footer has been designed using Bootstrap, it is fixed to the bottom of the page and takes up the whole width of the screen on all devices.
    * It contains four social media icons in the center of the footer bar.
    * These icons change color on hover to green to let the users know they are clickable (similar to the links in the navigation bar) and are 
    lnked to the external social media websites, which open in a new tab.

* **Socket**
    * Socket section is located below the footer and contains copyright symbol and the website address, which changes color to green on hover and is linked to our webpage.

    
#### Features specific for the pages
* **Home** 
    * Main banner image is intended to be colorful and bright to draw attention.
    * Bootstrap jumbotron with a heading: Love Food Stop Waste, contains main message and "Find Out More" button, if users wish to explore further, 
    which opens a page for [The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)](www.wrap.org.uk) in a new tab.
    * Food Facts - Bootstrap jumbotron with a custom colored background and Font Awesome icons to provide visual image and draw users' attention to the 
    information in the section. 
    * Info section followed by three column section, with images to support the text accordingly.

* **Plan** 
    * This page contains an image that represents it's content followed by a jumbotron with a custom background.
    * The Reduce Food Waste section describes the two main ways to achieve that and followed by two column Bootstrap card section. 
    Each card consists of an image to visually support the content of the section and two paragraphs of text.
   
* **Leftovers**
    * The heading of the page is placed on an image and located on top of the page.
    * It is followed by a text section and three column card section. The card with a new recipe contains Bootstrap Badge "New" so users can identify new content. 
   
* **Contact**  
    * This page contains a "Subscribe for a newsletter" form designrd using Bootstrap's JS Modal plug-in. 
    There are four fields on the form: First Name, Last Name, Email and Your Message (optional text field).
    * The modal has a custom background to make the page more inviting to the users.


### Features Left to Implement

* To make the website more child-friendly with colourful images, fun activities that help to stop food waste and fight climate change and lots of creative recipe ideas for children. 
* To add a new page "Food Share" with a map and addresses to show the local community food bank locations if users wish to donate food items, 
as well as using the food bank's services. This will broaden the user pool and strenthen the website's role in the community.
