### Existing Features

#### Features used across all pages

    * Navigation links are collapsed in small screen sizes into a hamburger menu.

    * All navigation links change color to green on hover and the current page's link stays "active", so the users can easily identify the page they are on.

* **Footer**
    * Footer has been designed using Bootstrap, it is fixed to the bottom of the page and takes up the whole width of the screen on all devices.
    * It contains four social media icons in the center of the footer bar.
